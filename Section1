Making the VR Game Dynamic using MERN::
--In this chapter, we will extend the MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js
(MERN) skeleton application to build the MERN VR Game application, and use it to
convert the static React 360 game developed in the previous chapter into a dynamic
game.
--We will achieve this by replacing the sample game data with game details
fetched directly from the database.

--We will use the MERN stack technologies to
implement a game model and Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) application
programming interfaces (APIs) in the backend, which will allow storage and
retrieval of games, and frontend views, which will allow users to make their own
games besides playing any of the games on the platform in their browser.

To make MERN VR Game a complete and dynamic game application, we will
implement the following:
--A game model schema to store game details in MongoDB
APIs for game CRUD operations
--React views for creating, editing, listing, and deleting games
--Updating the React 360 game to fetch data with the API
--Loading the VR game with dynamic game data.

Lecture 1:
Introducing the dynamic MERN VR Game application::
--On this platform, registered users will be able to make and
modify their own games by providing an equirectangular image for the game world,
and the VR object resources, including transform property values for each object to be
placed in the game world.

--Any visitor to the application will be able to browse
through all the games added by the makers and play any game, to find and collect the
3D objects in the game world that are relevant to the clue or description of each game.

--When a registered user signs into the application, they will see a home page with all
the games listed and an option to make their own game.

--We will add new React components related to creating, editing, and listing VR games,
and will also modify existing components such as the Profile, Menu, and Home
components as we build out the features of the MERN VR Game application in the
rest of the chapter. The core features in this game platform depend on the capability
to store specific details of each game
