Lecture 1:
Iterating and rendering the object details form::
--We will add the form interface seen in the previous section with Material-UI
ExpansionPanel components to create a modifiable list of VR objects for each type
of VR object array in the given game.

Adding a new object to the array::
--For each array rendered in the game form, we will add a button that will let users
push new VR objects to the given array. This button to add an object will render a
new VRObjectForm component to take the details of a new VR object.

Removing an object from the array::
-Each of the items rendered in the list of VR object forms can also be removed from the
list by the user.
--The VRObjectForm component displaying an item will contain a delete option, which will remove the object from the given array.
--To implement the remove item functionality for this DELETE button, we will pass a removeObject method as a prop to the VRObjectForm component from the
parent GameForm component.

Lecture 2:
Handling the object detail change::
--The details of any VR object in the game will be updated when the user changes input
values in any of the fields in the corresponding VR object form.
--The GameForm component renders the form elements for modifying the details of a game, including the lists of VR objects. Using this form, users can add, modify, and
delete VR objects in the lists. The lists render each item in a VR object form that the users can use to compose the details of the object. In the next section, we will
implement the React component that renders this.

The VRObjectForm component::
--We will implement the VRObjectForm component to render the input fields for modifying an individual VR object's details, which are added to the answerObjects
and wrongObjects arrays of the game in the GameForm component.

--These input fields will allow the user to set the details of a VR object in a game. When
any of these VR object details are changed in these input fields by the user, the
handleChange method will be invoked.

--The removeObject method will take the value of the object array type and the array
index position, to remove the given object from the relevant VR object array in
the GameForm component's state
