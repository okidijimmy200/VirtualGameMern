Lecture 1:
Iterating and rendering the object details form::
--We will add the form interface seen in the previous section with Material-UI
ExpansionPanel components to create a modifiable list of VR objects for each type
of VR object array in the given game.

Adding a new object to the array::
--For each array rendered in the game form, we will add a button that will let users
push new VR objects to the given array. This button to add an object will render a
new VRObjectForm component to take the details of a new VR object.

Removing an object from the array::
-Each of the items rendered in the list of VR object forms can also be removed from the
list by the user.
--The VRObjectForm component displaying an item will contain a delete option, which will remove the object from the given array.
--To implement the remove item functionality for this DELETE button, we will pass a removeObject method as a prop to the VRObjectForm component from the
parent GameForm component
